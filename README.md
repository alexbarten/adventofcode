# Advent of Code

My solutions to puzzles, that are described on the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website. test...

The project has been set up per day. The Advent of Code consists of 25 days (December 1 to 25), every year.

For each day, I have created a folder with the day number. Each folder contains three code files:

    [name of puzzle]_0 : This code implements the example tests, mentioned in the explanation of the puzzle.
    [name of puzzle]_1 : The first assignment.
    [name of puzzle]_2 : The second assignment.

For a few components a test component has been created in the Tests/ folder.
